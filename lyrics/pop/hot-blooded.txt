You've been crying baby
It's not your fault
And I've been dying baby
All over your walls
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
Just wait til I'm on board
Just wait til I'm on board
You've been running and so has your mind
But i'm thinking of you all the time
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I'm crawling on the floor
Who said they loved you more?
Baby baby I've been waiting for so long
Call me crazy, I think I'm what you're looking for
You've been out here setting the vibe
I wonder if you know my style
Just a little bit more
Just a little bit more
I'm crawling on the floor
Who said they loved you more
Baby baby I've been waiting for so long
Call me crazy I think I'm what you're looking for
Cause you don't always feel alright
You don't always feel alright
Coming out like it's on your mind mind mind mind
Hot blooded you've been running around
You know you talk crazy when you try to get out
And you know you're my baby yeah you're coming around
You know I'm just like you so let's tear this shit down
And it feels so right
Though I ain't got the time so
You could make it right
But please don't waste my time
And it feels so right
Though I ain't got the time so
You could make it right
But please don't waste my time
You've been crying
I see it's not your fault
Baby I've been dying
All over your walls
